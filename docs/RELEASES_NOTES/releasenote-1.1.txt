Release Notes for persist-queue 1.1
====================================

Major Update: Migration from nose2 to pytest testing framework

Overview
--------
This release migrates the project's testing framework from nose2 to pytest, improving
modernity and maintainability of tests. It also fixes several async queue-related bugs
and ensures strict compliance with PEP8 code standards.

Major Changes
-------------

Testing Framework Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Migrated testing framework from nose2 to pytest
* Updated tox.ini configuration to support pytest and pytest-asyncio
* Modified all test files to use pytest-style decorators and assertions
* Added pytest-cov support for code coverage reporting

Dependency Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Removed nose2 dependency
* Added pytest>=6.0.0
* Added pytest-asyncio>=0.18.0
* Added pytest-cov>=4.0.0
* Retained other test dependencies (mock, flake8, eventlet, etc.)

Async Queue Feature Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added persistqueue/async_queue.py - Async queue implementation
* Added persistqueue/serializers/async_pickle.py - Async pickle serializer
* Fixed EOFError issues in async queues
* Improved async timeout exception handling
* Optimized async file operations and locking mechanisms

Code Quality Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Strict compliance with PEP8 code standards
* Fixed all flake8 warnings
* Improved code formatting and whitespace handling
* Optimized exception handling and import statements

Test Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added skip conditions for MySQL tests (when local MySQL service is unavailable)
* Fixed async test integration with pytest-asyncio
* Improved test parameterization and assertion methods
* Enhanced test coverage and stability

File Change Details
------------------

New Files:
* persistqueue/async_queue.py - Core async queue implementation
* persistqueue/serializers/async_pickle.py - Async pickle serializer

Modified Files:
* tox.ini - Updated test environment configuration
* test-requirements.txt - Updated test dependencies
* persistqueue/tests/test_queue.py - Migrated to pytest style
* persistqueue/tests/test_priorityqueue.py - Migrated to pytest style
* persistqueue/tests/test_sqlqueue.py - Migrated to pytest style
* persistqueue/tests/test_sqlackqueue.py - Migrated to pytest style
* persistqueue/tests/test_mysqlqueue.py - Migrated to pytest style
* persistqueue/tests/test_pdict.py - Migrated to pytest style

Technical Details
----------------

Async Queue Implementation:
* Asyncio-based async queue implementation
* Support for async serializers
* Improved file locking and concurrency control
* Optimized memory usage and performance

Serializer Improvements:
* New async pickle serializer
* Support for async file operations
* Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

Testing Framework Benefits:
* pytest provides richer assertion and parameterization features
* Better test discovery and execution mechanisms
* Built-in async test support
* More detailed test reports and coverage analysis

Compatibility
-------------
* Maintains full compatibility with existing synchronous APIs
* Async APIs are new features that don't affect existing code
* All existing test cases maintain their functionality

Installation and Usage
---------------------
* Run tests with tox: tox -e py312
* Run code style checks: tox -e pep8
* Generate coverage reports: tox -e cover
* Run async tests: pytest --asyncio-mode=auto

Known Issues
-----------
* MySQL tests require local MySQL service, otherwise they will be skipped automatically
* Async features require Python 3.7+ and asyncio support

Future Plans
-----------
* Further optimize async queue performance
* Add support for more async serializers
* Enhance error handling and monitoring capabilities
* Improve documentation and example code
