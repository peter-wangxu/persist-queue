This project is based on the achievements of `python-pqueue <https://github.com/balena/python-pqueue>`_
and `queuelib <https://github.com/scrapy/queuelib>`_

The goals is to achieve following requirements:

* Disk-based: each queued item should be stored in disk in case of any crash.
* Thread-safe: can be used by multi-threaded producers and multi-threaded consumers.
* Recoverable: Items can be read after process restart.
* Green-compatible: can be used in ``greenlet`` or ``eventlet`` environment.

While *queuelib* and *python-pqueue* cannot fulfil all of above. After some try, I found it's hard to achieve based on their current
implementation without huge code change. this is the motivation to start this project.

*persist-queue* use *pickle* object serialization module to support object instances.
To support customized objects, please refer to `Pickling and unpickling extension types(Python2) <https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#pickling-and-unpickling-normal-class-instances>`_
and `Pickling Class Instances(Python3) <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickling-class-instances>`_

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7 or Python 3.x.
* Full support for Linux.
* Windows support (with `Caution`_ if ``persistqueue.Queue`` is used).

Installation
------------

from pypi
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    pip install persist-queue

from source code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/peter-wangxu/persist-queue
    cd persist-queue
    python setup.py install


Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from persistqueue import Queue
    >>> q = Queue("mypath")
    >>> q.put('a')
    >>> q.put('b')
    >>> q.put('c')
    >>> q.get()
    'a'
    >>> q.task_done()


Close the python console, and then we restart the queue from the same path,

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from persistqueue import Queue
    >>> q = Queue('mypath')
    >>> q.get()
    'b'
    >>> q.task_done()

example usage with multi-thread(referred from github project python-pqueue):

.. code-block:: python

    from persistqueue import Queue

    q = Queue()

    def worker():
        while True:
            item = q.get()
            do_work(item)
            q.task_done()

    for i in range(num_worker_threads):
         t = Thread(target=worker)
         t.daemon = True
         t.start()

    for item in source():
        q.put(item)

    q.join()       # block until all tasks are done


example usage for **SQLite3** based queue.

.. code-block:: python

    from persistqueue import FIFOSQLiteQueue

    q = FIFOSQLiteQueue(path="./test", multithreading=True)

    def worker():
        while True:
            item = q.get()
            do_work(item)

    for i in range(num_worker_threads):
         t = Thread(target=worker)
         t.daemon = True
         t.start()

    for item in source():
        q.put(item)


Tests
-----

*persist-queue* use ``tox`` to trigger tests.

to trigger tests based on python2.7/python3.x, use:

.. code-block:: console

    tox -e py27

.. code-block:: console

    tox -e py34

.. code-block:: console

    tox -e py35

.. code-block:: console

    tox -e py36

to trigger pep8 check, use:

.. code-block:: console

   tox -e pep8


`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ is usually a helpful tool to manage multiple versions of Python.

Caution
-------

Currently, the atomic operation is not supported on Windows due to the limitation of Python's `os.rename <https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.rename>`_,
That's saying, the data in ``persistqueue.Queue`` could be in unreadable state when an incidential failure occurs during ``Queue.task_done``.

**DO NOT PUT ANY CRITICAL DATA ON persistqueue.QUEUE WHEN RUNNING ON WINDOWS**.

Contribution
------------

Simply fork this repo and send PR for your code change(also tests to cover your change), remember to give a title and description of your PR. I am willing to
enhance this project with you :).

FAQ
---

* ``sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`` is raised.

persistquest open 2 connections for the db if ``multithreading=True``, the
SQLite database is locked until that transaction is committed. The ``timeout``
parameter specifies how long the connection should wait for the lock to go away
until raising an exception. Default time is **10**, increase ``timeout``
when creating the queue if above error occurs.
